Let's learn what is Security.txt file:
---------------------------------------

A security.txt file is a standardized text file that contains contact
information for a website's security team.
It's placed in a website's root directory and is intended to be readable by both humans and machines.
Security researchers can use the file to easily contact the right person or department
within an organization to report vulnerabilities they've found in the website or IT systems.
